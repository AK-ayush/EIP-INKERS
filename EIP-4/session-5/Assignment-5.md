## Assignment 5

As part of this assignment, I have trained several nural network models from scratch. 

[Final Notebook](./Copy_of_PersonAttrubutes_final.ipynb)

I have applied following approaches:  

1. Standariazation and noramalization
2. Random cutout regulazier
3. Image Data augmentation
4. Varrying learning rate
5. Train/Test split `70:30`


With all these techniques, after training the notebook for 100 epochs, I got the minimum validation loss `8.09`.
